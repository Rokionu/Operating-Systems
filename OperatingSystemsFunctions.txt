One function of an operating system is processor management. Processor management controls the order 
that each process has access to the processor and how much processing time each process will take. Processes are normally 
generated by user input and have an order of priority due to a scheduling manager.

Another function of an operating system is memory management. Memory management stores bytes or different 
characters into unique addresses for fast retrieval by the CPU. The OS is able to allocate storage to 
the memory management system when needed and deallocate it when the program is no longer needed.
